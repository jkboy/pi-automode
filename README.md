# pi-automode

Claude Code-style auto mode for Pi.

This is a guardrail extension. It intercepts agent tool calls before execution and blocks actions that match permission deny rules, deterministic hard-deny checks, or the auto-mode classifier's block decision.

It is not a sandbox. Extensions run in the Pi process, and a determined malicious extension can do anything your user account can do. It also does not guard user `!` / `!!` shell commands; by design, it guards agent tool calls only. Use this to reduce unsafe autonomous tool use, not as an OS security boundary.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@czottmann/pi-automode
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
pi install .
```

For one run from a local checkout:

```bash
pi -e ./extensions/auto-mode.ts
```

## Commands

```text
/automode status    # current state, rules, and classifier
/automode on        # re-enable for this session
/automode off       # disable for this session
/automode reload    # reload config from disk
/automode reset     # reset denial counters only
/automode defaults  # print the built-in rule lists
/automode config    # effective config, resolved log file path, + diagnostics
/automode denials   # denial history for this session
/automode model     # open classifier model selector and save to ~/.pi/agent/automode.json
/automode model provider/model-id # save classifier model to ~/.pi/agent/automode.json
```

`/auto-mode` is an alias.

## Status line

When the Pi TUI is available, the extension renders a persistent status line:

```text
AM● a:12 d:2 ca:5 cd:1
```

- `AM` — auto-mode prefix; `●` when enabled, `○` when disabled (via config or `/automode off`).
- `a:` — actions allowed so far (checked minus denied).
- `d:` — actions denied so far, for any reason (permission rule, deterministic hard-deny, or classifier).
- `ca:` / `cd:` — classifier decisions split into allowed vs denied. These segments appear only after the classifier has run at least once; `d:` counts all denials, so `d:` is always `>= cd:`.

## Configuration

The extension follows Claude Code's documented config model where Pi can support it.

It reads `autoMode` from Pi-owned config only:

- `~/.pi/agent/automode.json`
- `.pi/automode.local.json`
- `PI_AUTOMODE_SETTINGS_JSON`

It deliberately does not read `autoMode` from shared project `.pi/automode.json`, because a checked-in repo should not be able to weaken auto-mode rules. Shared project config may still contribute `permissions.deny` and `permissions.ask`.

To disable pi-automode for the current project, create or edit `.pi/automode.local.json`:

```json
{
  "autoMode": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

This is project-local and should not be committed. Shared project `.pi/automode.json` cannot disable auto-mode.

Set a global default classifier model in `~/.pi/agent/automode.json`; override it per project in `.pi/automode.local.json`.

`classifierReasoningLevel` optionally requests `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` reasoning for both classifier stages. If the key is absent, pi-automode sends no reasoning preference and leaves the choice to the server. Pi AI clamps unsupported values to the nearest level supported by the selected model; a non-reasoning model resolves to `off`. `low` matches Codex Auto Review's reasoning effort and the practical default when an explicit value is needed. Higher levels can consume the existing 512/1200-token stage limits before producing visible output, which causes the classifier to fail closed. Raise `fastClassifierMaxTokens` (default 512, integer ≥ 16) if you run a reasoning model whose fast-stage budget is truncated before it emits the required `0`/`1` digit.

The setting follows the normal scalar precedence: global, then project-local, then `PI_AUTOMODE_SETTINGS_JSON`. Shared project `.pi/automode.json` cannot set it. Omitting the key at a higher-precedence scope does not clear a lower-precedence value.

Example:

```json
{
  "autoMode": {
    "classifierModel": "provider/model-id",
    "classifierReasoningLevel": "low",
    "classifyReadOnlyTools": false,
    "fastClassifierMaxTokens": 512,
    "classifierRetry": { "maxAttempts": 3, "baseDelayMs": 1000 },
    "maxUserTranscriptTokens": 4000,
    "maxToolTranscriptTokens": 4000,
    "environment": [
      "$defaults",
      "Source control: github.example.com/acme-corp and all repos under it",
      "Trusted internal domains: *.corp.example.com, git.example.com",
      "Trusted cloud buckets: s3://acme-dev-artifacts, gs://acme-ci-cache",
      "Key internal services: staging deploy API at deploy.corp.example.com"
    ],
    "allow": ["$defaults"],
    "protectedPaths": ["$defaults"],
    "soft_deny": ["$defaults"],
    "hard_deny": [
      "$defaults",
      "Never send repository contents to third-party code-review APIs"
    ]
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["bash(rm -rf *)"],
    "ask": ["bash(git push *)"]
  }
}
```

`maxUserTranscriptTokens` and `maxToolTranscriptTokens` are approximate per-category budgets; both default to 4000 and accept integers of at least 32. The former `maxTranscriptLines` setting is no longer supported because evidence selection is token-budgeted rather than line-based.

### Classifier retry

Transient completion failures (network errors, timeouts, 5xx responses, stream failures) are retried with exponential backoff before auto mode fails closed: `baseDelayMs × 2^(n-1)` after the n-th failure, up to `classifierRetry.maxAttempts` total attempts (default 3 attempts, 1s base delay — worst case adds ~3s). Deterministic failures (auth, billing/quota exhaustion, invalid requests) fail closed immediately without retrying, and an exhausted budget still fails closed. Aborting the request cancels any pending backoff wait and fails closed. Malformed output — a fast-stage response that is not `0`/`1`, or detailed-stage output that is not valid decision JSON — is retried once immediately, without backoff. `maxAttempts` accepts integers ≥ 1 (1 disables transient retries); `baseDelayMs` accepts integers ≥ 0.

### Ask-user tools and explicit authorization

Classifier evidence includes normal user messages and assistant tool-call inputs, but excludes assistant prose and all tool results. This includes answers returned by ask-user tools such as `@vanillagreen/pi-questions`. Selecting "Yes" there helps the agent decide what to do next, but pi-automode does not treat that tool result as explicit authorization to override a soft deny. Send the authorization as a normal chat message instead; the agent can then retry the action. Tool results are excluded because they may contain untrusted or prompt-injected content.

### `$defaults`

See [Defaults and rule-list behavior](docs/defaults.md) for built-in `environment`, `allow`, `protectedPaths`, `soft_deny`, and `hard_deny` entries, plus replacement behavior when `$defaults` is omitted.

### Observability logging

Auto mode can write a JSONL observability log next to the current Pi session file, so you can inspect decisions and classifier usage. It is off by default.

```json
{
  "autoMode": {
    "log": {
      "enabled": true,
      "classifierIo": false
    }
  }
}
```

With logging enabled, the sidecar also writes ccusage-compatible entries for every classifier response. `ccusage pi` reports this usage as a separate `-pi-automode` session even when `classifierIo` is off.

See [Observability logging](docs/observability-logging.md) for the log file location, entry schema, and the `classifierIo` privacy tradeoff. Run `/automode config` to see the resolved log file path.

### Permission patterns

Permission patterns use Pi tool names, for example `bash(...)`, `write(...)`, `edit(...)`, `read(...)`. The parser accepts capitalized names like `Bash(...)` for convenience, but the documented form is lowercase because Pi tool names are lowercase.

## What is enforced before the classifier

The extension blocks these before any allow or classifier decision:

- `permissions.deny` matches
- declined `permissions.ask` matches
- shell profile writes
- SSH `authorized_keys` writes
- cron, launch agent, and system service persistence
- TLS/certificate/auth weakening patterns
- root, home, and system-path destructive deletes
- edits to `.pi/automode*`, `.pi` auto-mode files, and this extension's safety-control files

Read-only Pi tools (`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) are allowed after those checks. Every side-effecting action goes to the classifier, including all `write` and `edit` calls, `bash`, MCP, subagent, network-capable tools, and unknown tools. This keeps classifier hard-deny rules unconditional; direct file writes cannot bypass them. Set `classifyReadOnlyTools: true` to route read-only tools through the classifier as well, so reads outside the trusted working tree can be denied by policy. With it enabled, every `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls` call runs the two-stage classifier, which raises the number of model calls, the latency, and the cost per session.

Classification starts with a one-token conservative filter and runs structured review only when that filter requests it. Both stages use a classifier-specific session key and short provider cache retention where the provider supports it. Missing models, provider failures, or malformed responses block the action.

## Examples

- `examples/automode.local.json`: copy to `.pi/automode.local.json` in a project and edit the domains, buckets, and source-control org.

## Known limits

Claude Code's real classifier and exact built-in rules are private. This package implements the documented precedence and configuration behavior, with a local classifier prompt and deterministic hard-deny checks.

## Development

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
```

The tests cover the risky parts: scoped permission matching, config-source precedence, `$defaults` behavior, config diagnostics, deterministic hard-deny checks, shell parsing, write/edit classifier routing, symlink-aware safety-control checks, token-budgeted transcript selection, staged classifier parsing and caching options, and hook-level blocking/allowing.

## Publishing

GitHub Actions publishes the package to npm when a GitHub Release is published. The release tag must match `package.json` exactly, with or without a leading `v` (`v1.0.0` and `1.0.0` both work for version `1.0.0`).

The workflow uses npm Trusted Publishing, so it does not need an npm token secret. Configure this package on npm with this repository and workflow file (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`). The workflow builds the package, runs `npm run check`, and publishes with npm provenance.

### Release tag must point at the version bump

The publish workflow checks out the commit the release tag points at and compares `package.json` against the tag name. **The tag must point at a commit where `package.json` already carries the new version.** Concretely: commit the version bump (`chore: release X.Y.Z`), push `main`, then create the GitHub release targeting that pushed commit. Creating the release before pushing the version bump — or targeting a commit that still has the old version — fails the `Check release tag` step with `Release tag (vX.Y.Z) does not match package.json version (x.y.z)`.

If the tag was cut against the wrong commit, fix it by force-moving it to the version-bump commit and pushing, then trigger the workflow via `gh workflow run publish.yml --ref vX.Y.Z` (the `release` event fires on tag creation; re-running a failed `release`-triggered run reuses the original ref and won't pick up the moved tag).
